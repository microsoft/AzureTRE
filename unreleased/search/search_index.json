The airlock capability is the only mechanism that allows users to <code>import</code> or <code>export</code> data, tools or other file based artefacts in a secure fashion with a human approval. This constitutes the mechanism focused on preventing data exfiltration and securing TRE and its workspaces from inappropriate data, while allowing researchers to work on their projects and execute their tasks.
