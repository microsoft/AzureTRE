# Case Studies

## Barts Health Data Platform
Launched in April 2025 with the support of PA Consulting, the [Barts Health Data Platform](https://data.bartshealth.nhs.uk/)
brings together hospital, imaging and laboratory records for 2.5 million patients, reflecting the extraordinary diversity of East London. A key component of the platform is an Azure Trusted Research Environment that gives clinicians and academics a ready-to-analyse view of over a decade of longitudinal data.
Early projects have already yielded impact—one study identified previously missed diabetes-related vascular problems, enabling earlier treatment and fewer amputations. Looking ahead, Barts Health NHS Trust plans to grow the platform so that the integrated TRE can host up to 300 concurrent research projects, opening the door to wider collaboration across academia, industry and the NHS.

## CloudKubed and Imperial College London
Imperial College London partnered with CloudKubed to address the increasing demands for scalable and centralised research solutions. The challenge was to enhance project visibility, streamline end-to-end research, and improve the management of research projects. CloudKubed implemented a cloud-based Azure Trusted Research Environment (TRE) aligned with Imperial’s strategy and needs.
This TRE integrated approval processes and provided a secure, compliant environment for research. The outcome allowed Imperial to efficiently provision workspaces, facilitate access to research tools, and streamline the entire research process. The partnership significantly improved the efficiency of research operations and compliance with data security measures.

## Building the Trusted Research Environment with Azure Databricks
The importance of secure and scalable data environments in healthcare research has grown, particularly highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Trusted Research Environments (TREs) enable secure collaboration on sensitive data while maintaining patient privacy. Azure Databricks enhances TREs by offering scalable, secure, and flexible data processing capabilities.
The integration of Azure Databricks into the Azure TRE blueprint allows researchers to perform complex data analysis securely, promoting innovative research and improved healthcare outcomes.

## Data Saves Lives: Lessons to Enable Healthcare Research by PA Consulting
The UK Government's investment in secure data environments (SDEs) aims to make health data more accessible for research, enhancing patient outcomes and accelerating life sciences research.
Key lessons from implementing SDEs include leveraging cloud technologies for scalability, publicising access and pricing to facilitate research, and improving communication to drive public consent. Establishing clear data roles and shared services, building trust through transparency, and starting small to scale effectively are critical for success.
These steps ensure that health data can be used ethically and efficiently, transforming care and services in the UK.
