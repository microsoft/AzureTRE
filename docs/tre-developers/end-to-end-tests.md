# End-to-end (E2E) tests

## Prerequisites

1. Authentication and Authorization configuration set up as noted [here](../tre-admins/auth.md)
1. An Azure Tre deployed environment.

## Registering bundles to run End-to-end tests

End-to-end tests depend on certain bundles to be registered within the TRE API.

When End-to-end tests run in CI, they are registered as a prerequisite to running tests.

When running tests locally, use the `prepare-for-e2e` Makefile target:

```cmd
make prepare-for-e2e
```

## Debugging the End-to-End tests

Use the "Run and Debug" panel within Visual Studio Code, select "E2E Extended", "E2E Smoke" or "E2E Performance" in the drop down box and click play.

- Values from `config.yaml` are copied to `/workspaces/AzureTRE/e2e_tests/.env`.

- Outputs from the core deployment are read from `/workspaces/AzureTRE/core/private.env`.
