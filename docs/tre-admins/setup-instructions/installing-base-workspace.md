# Installing base workspace

## Publishing and registering the base workspace bundle

Run the following in a terminal to build, publish and register the base workpace bundle:

```cmd
make workspace_bundle BUNDLE=base
```

This will prepare the template for use with your TRE.

## Creating a base workspace

Now that we have published and registered a base workspace bundle we can use the deployed API to create a base workspace.

!!! info
    All routes are auth protected. Click the green **Authorize** button to receive a token for Swagger client.

As explained in the [auth guide](../auth.md), every workspace has a corresponding app registration which if you haven't run `make auth`; can be created using the helper script `./devops/scripts/aad/create_workspace_application.sh`. For example:

```bash
  ./devops/scripts/aad/create_workspace_application.sh \
    --name "${TRE_ID} - workspace 1" \
    --admin-consent \
    --ux-clientid "${SWAGGER_UI_CLIENT_ID}" \
    --automation-clientid "${TEST_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_ID}" \
    --application-admin-clientid "${APPLICATION_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID}"
```

!!! caution
    If you're using a separate tenant for Microsoft Entra ID app registrations to the one where you've deployed the TRE infrastructure resources, ensure you've signed into that tenant in the `az cli` before running the above command. See **Using a separate Microsoft Entra ID tenant** in [Setup Auth configuration](setup-auth-entities.md) for more details.

Running the script will report `workspace_api_client_id` and `workspace_api_client_secret` for the generated app. Add these under the authenrication section in `/config.yaml` so that automated testing will work. You also need to use `workspace_api_client_id` in the POST body below.

### Create workspace using the API
Go to `https://<azure_tre_fqdn>/api/docs` and use POST `/api/workspaces` with the sample body to create a base workspace.

```json
{
  "templateName": "tre-workspace-base",
  "properties": {
    "display_name": "manual-from-swagger",
    "description": "workspace for team X",
    "client_id":"<WORKSPACE_API_CLIENT_ID>",
    "client_secret":"<WORKSPACE_API_CLIENT_SECRET>",
    "address_space_size": "medium"
  }
}
```

The API will return an `operation` object with a `Location` header to query the operation status, as well as the `resourceId` and `resourcePath` properties to query the resource under creation.

You can also follow the progress in Azure portal as various resources come up.

Workspace level operations can now be carried out using the workspace API, at `/api/workspaces/<workspace_id>/docs/`.
