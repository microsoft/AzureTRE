# Pipelines

The [AzureTRE deployment repository](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureTRE-Deployment) contains the following github workflows:

1. Build Validation - validates the code by running linter and terraform validation.
1. Clean Validation Environments - a periodical workflow to clean unused AzureTRE environments.
1. Deploy Azure TRE (branch) - This workflow is intended to be used to test workflow changes. It deploys AzureTRE using the workflows defined on the branch
1. Deploy Azure TRE - This workflow is the integration build run for pushes to the main branch. It also runs on a schedule, serving as the nightly build to keep the main AzureTRE env in sync.
1. Deploy Azure TRE Reusable - responsible to deploy AzureTRE. It is referenced in other Azure TRE deployment workflows.


## Setup Github Environment

The workflows are using Github environment to source its environment variables. Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment) to define it in your github repository and provide it as an input for the workflows.

The following environment variables should be defined in your github environment:

1. [Auth env vars](../../tre-admins/auth.md##create_authentication_assets)
1. [Core and Devops env vars](../../tre-admins/environment-variables.md)

Having all the environment variables set in the Github environment the next step will be to use it in your pipelines:

In AzureTRE deployment repository You will find all the pipelines under the folder `.github/workflows` on top of each workflow there is the workflow
inputs part where the used Github environment name is set, make sure to update it with yours, for example:

![Setup env in pipeline](../../assets/using-tre/pipelines_set_env.png)

## Azure Resource Provider Registration

Before running any CI/CD pipelines that deploy Azure TRE, ensure that the required Azure resource providers are registered in your target subscription. This is a one-time setup step per subscription.

You can register the required providers by running:

```bash
make register-providers
```

This command registers the following providers and features required by Azure TRE:
- Microsoft.Storage
- Microsoft.AlertsManagement  
- Microsoft.Compute
- Microsoft.Compute/EncryptionAtHost feature

Alternatively, you can add a step to your CI/CD pipeline to run this command before the main deployment steps.

## Publish Custom Templates in Pipelines

If you have created custom AzureTRE templates you can publish and register them as part of the CI/CD pipelines.
To do so go to `.github/workflows/deploy_tre_reusable.yml` workflow and add your template under the following jobs:

1. publish_bundles
    ![Publish bundle](../../assets/using-tre/push_bundles_step.png)
1. register_bundles
    ![Register bundle](../../assets/using-tre/register_bundles.png)
1. If it is a user resource add it also under register_user_resource_bundles
    ![Register user resource step](../../assets/using-tre/register_user_resource.png)
