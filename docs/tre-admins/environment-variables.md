# Environment variables

!!! info
    The `.tfvars` file is intentionally not used. The `.env` file format is easier to parse, meaning we can use the values for bash scripts and other purposes.

## For Azure TRE instance in `/config.yaml`

| <div style="width: 330px">Environment variable name</div> | Description |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| `TRE_ID` | A globally unique identifier. `TRE_ID` can be found in the resource names of the Azure TRE instance; for example, a `TRE_ID` of `mytre-dev` will result in a resource group name for Azure TRE instance of `rg-mytre-dev`. This must be less than 12 characters. Allowed characters: lowercase alphanumerics|
| `TRE_URL`| This will be generated for you by populating your `TRE_ID`. This is used so that you can automatically register bundles |
| `CORE_ADDRESS_SPACE` | The address space for the Azure TRE core virtual network. `/22` or larger. |
| `TRE_ADDRESS_SPACE` | The address space for the whole TRE environment virtual network where workspaces networks will be created (can include the core network as well). E.g. `10.0.0.0/12`|
| `ENABLE_SWAGGER` | Determines whether the Swagger interface for the API will be available. |
| `SWAGGER_UI_CLIENT_ID` | Generated when following [pre-deployment steps](./setup-instructions/setup-auth-entities.md) guide. Client ID for swagger client to make requests. |
| `AAD_TENANT_ID` | Generated when following [pre-deployment steps](./setup-instructions/setup-auth-entities.md) guide. Tenant id against which auth is performed. |

In certain locations a dynamic script to retrieve this from [https://ipecho.net/plain](https://ipecho.net/plain) does not work. If this is the case, then you can 'hardcode' your IP. |
