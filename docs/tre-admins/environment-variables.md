# Environment variables

!!! info
    The `.tfvars` file is intentionally not used. The `.env` file format is easier to parse, meaning we can use the values for bash scripts and other purposes.

## For shared management resources in `/config.yaml`

## For Azure TRE instance in `/config.yaml`

| <div style="width: 330px">Environment variable name</div> | Description |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| `TRE_ID` | A globally unique identifier. `TRE_ID` can be found in the resource names of the Azure TRE instance; for example, a `TRE_ID` of `mytre-dev` will result in a resource group name for Azure TRE instance of `rg-mytre-dev`. This must be less than 12 characters. Allowed characters: lowercase alphanumerics|
| `TRE_URL`| This will be generated for you by populating your `TRE_ID`. This is used so that you can automatically register bundles |
| `CORE_ADDRESS_SPACE` | The address space for the Azure TRE core virtual network. `/22` or larger. |
| `TRE_ADDRESS_SPACE` | The address space for the whole TRE environment virtual network where workspaces networks will be created (can include the core network as well). E.g. `10.0.0.0/12`|
| `ENABLE_SWAGGER` | Determines whether the Swagger interface for the API will be available. |
| `SWAGGER_UI_CLIENT_ID` | Generated when following [pre-deployment steps](./setup-instructions/setup-auth-entities.md) guide. Client ID for swagger client to make requests. |
| `AAD_TENANT_ID` | Generated when following [pre-deployment steps](./setup-instructions/setup-auth-entities.md) guide. Tenant id against which auth is performed. |
| `API_CLIENT_ID` | Generated when following [pre-deployment steps](./setup-instructions/setup-auth-entities.md) guide. Client id of the "TRE API". |
| `API_CLIENT_SECRET` | Generated when following [pre-deployment steps](./setup-instructions/setup-auth-entities.md) guide. Client secret of the "TRE API". |
| `STATEFUL_RESOURCES_LOCKED` | If set to `false` locks on stateful resources won't be created. A recommended setting for developers. |
| `KV_PURGE_PROTECTION_ENABLED` | If set to `false` the core Key Vault's purge protection will be disabled so it can be reused upon deletion. A recommended setting for developers. |
| `ENABLE_AIRLOCK_MALWARE_SCANNING` | If False, Airlock requests will skip the malware scanning stage. If set to True, Defender for Storage will be enabled. |
| `ENABLE_LOCAL_DEBUGGING` | Set to `false` by default. Setting this to `true` will ensure that Azure resources are accessible from your local development machine. (e.g. ServiceBus and Cosmos) |
| `PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_IP_ADDRESS` | The public IP address of the machine that is deploying TRE. (Your desktop or the build agents). In certain locations a dynamic script to retrieve this from [https://ipecho.net/plain](https://ipecho.net/plain) does not work. If this is the case, then you can 'hardcode' your IP. |
| `RESOURCE_PROCESSOR_VMSS_SKU` | The SKU of the VMMS to use for the resource processing VM. |
| `CORE_APP_SERVICE_PLAN_SKU` | The SKU of AppService plans created for the core infrastructure. |
| `WORKSPACE_APP_SERVICE_PLAN_SKU` | Optional. The SKU used for AppService plan used in E2E tests unless otherwise specified. Default value is `P1v2`. |
| `RESOURCE_PROCESSOR_NUMBER_PROCESSES_PER_INSTANCE` | Optional. The number of processes to instantiate when the Resource Processor starts. Equates to the number of parallel deployment operations possible in your TRE. Defaults to `5`. |
| `FIREWALL_SKU` | Optional. The SKU of the Azure Firewall instance. Default value is `Standard`. Allowed values [`Basic`, `Standard`, `Premium`]. See [Azure Firewall SKU feature comparison](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/choose-firewall-sku). |
| `APP_GATEWAY_SKU` | Optional. The SKU of the Application Gateway. Default value is `Standard_v2`. Allowed values [`Standard_v2`, `WAF_v2`] |
| `DEPLOY_BASTION` | Optional. If set to `true`, an Azure Bastion instance will be deployed. Default value is `true`. |
| `BASTION_SKU` | Optional. The SKU of the Azure Bastion instance. Default value is `Basic`. Allowed values [`Developer`, `Standard`, `Basic`, `Premium`]. See [Azure Bastion SKU feature comparison](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-overview#sku). |
| `CUSTOM_DOMAIN` | Optional. Custom domain name to access the Azure TRE portal. See [Custom domain name](custom-domain.md). |
| `ENABLE_CMK_ENCRYPTION` | Optional. Default is `false`, if set to `true` customer-managed key encryption will be enabled for all supported resources. |
| `AUTO_WORKSPACE_APP_REGISTRATION`| Set to `false` by default. Setting this to `true` grants the `Application.ReadWrite.All` and `Directory.Read.All` permission to the *Application Admin* identity. This identity is used to manage other Microsoft Entra ID applications that it owns, e.g. Workspaces. If you do not set this, the identity will have `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` permission. [Further information on Application Admin can be found here](./identities/application_admin.md). |
| `AUTO_WORKSPACE_GROUP_CREATION`| Set to `false` by default. Setting this to `true` grants the `Group.ReadWrite.All` permission to the *Application Admin* identity. This identity can then create security groups aligned to each applciation role. Microsoft Entra ID licencing implications need to be considered as Group assignment is a premium feature. [You can read mode about Group Assignment here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/multitenant-identity/app-roles#roles-using-azure-ad-app-roles). |
| `AUTO_GRANT_WORKSPACE_CONSENT`| Default of `false`.  Setting this to `true` will remove the need for users to manually grant consent when creating new workspaces. The identity will be granted `Application.ReadWrite.All` and `DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All` permissions. |
| `USER_MANAGEMENT_ENABLED` | If set to `true`, TRE Admins will be able to assign and de-assign users to workspaces via the UI (Requires Entra ID groups to be enabled on the workspace and the workspace template version to be 2.2.0 or greater). |
