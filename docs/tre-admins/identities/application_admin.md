# The Application Administrator Identity

## Purpose
This identity's credentials are stored in the core key vault and are used when you wish to update Microsoft Entra ID Applications. For instance, when you add Guacamole as a Workspace Service, you would need to add the URI of the Guacamole Service as a Redirect URI to the Workspace App to complete the login flow.

## Application Roles
This application does not have any roles defined.

## Microsoft Graph Permissions
| Name | Type* | Admin consent required |  TRE usage |
| --- | -- | -----| --------- |
| Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy | Application | Yes | This user has `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` as a minimum permission for it to function. If the tenant is managed by a customer administrator, then this user must be added to the **Owners** of every workspace that is created. This will allow TRE to manage the Microsoft Entra ID Application. This will be a manual process for the Tenant Admin. |
| Application.ReadWrite.All | Application | Yes | This permission is required to create workspace applications and administer any applications in the tenant. This is needed if the Microsoft Entra ID Administrator has delegated Microsoft Entra ID administrative operations to the TRE. There will be no need for the Tenant Admin to manually create workspace applications in the Tenant. |
| Directory.Read.All | Application | Yes | This permission is required to read User details from Microsoft Entra ID. This is needed if the Microsoft Entra ID Administrator has delegated Microsoft Entra ID administrative operations to the TRE. |
| Group.ReadWrite.All | Application | Yes | This permission is required to create and update Microsoft Entra ID groups. This is requried if Microsoft Entra ID groups are to be created automatically by the TRE. |

'*' See the difference between [delegated and application permission](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/auth/auth-concepts#delegated-and-application-permissions) types. See [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference) for more details.
