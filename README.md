# Azure Trusted Research Environment

## Project Status

The aim is to bring together learnings from past customer engagements where TREs have been built into a single reference solution. This is a solution accelerator aiming to be a great starting point for a customized TRE solution. You're encouraged to download and customize the solution to meet your requirements

This project does not have a dedicated team of maintainers but relies on you and the community to maintain and enhance the solution. Microsoft will on project-to-project basis continue to extend the solution in collaboration with customers and partners. No guarantees can be offered as to response times on issues, feature requests, or to the long term road map for the project.

It is important before deployment of the solution that the [Support Policy](SUPPORT.md) is read and understood.

## Background

Across the health industry, be it a pharmaceutical company interrogating clinical trial results, or a public health provider analyzing electronic health records, there is the need to enable researchers, analysts, and developers to work with sensitive data sets.

Trusted Research Environments (TREs) enforce a secure boundary around distinct workspaces to enable information governance controls to be enforced. Each workspace is accessible by a set of authorized users, prevents the exfiltration of sensitive data, and has access to one or more datasets provided by the data platform.

Workspaces can be configured with a variety of tools to enable tasks such as the development of machine learning models, data engineering, data analysis, and software development. Authorized users should be able to deploy and configure their tools without a dependency on IT teams.

A successful Trusted Research Environments enables users to be as productive, if not more productive than they would be working in environments without strict information governance controls.
