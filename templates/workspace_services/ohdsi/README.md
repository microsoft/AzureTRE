# OHDSI Workspace Service

## IMPORTANT
- This workspace service does not work "out of the box". It requires additional networking configuration to work properly.
- Currently the only CDM data source supported by the workspace service is Azure Synapse.

Further details are provided in the [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTRE/latest/tre-templates/workspace-services/ohdsi/).
